***Summary of colorplot.sh

Interactive script - to be run after parameter space scan has been performed

Will plot, for a user-selected ShelfMC scan, the effective volume versus any two variables of the user's choice (out of the 5 parameters we vary:
attenuation length, antenna radius, ice thickness, firn depth, and station depth)

Also will allow user to choose what values to hold the other 3 variables constant at
Will add together necessary files, create root script for plotting, and execute root script

***To use colorplot.sh:

On line 6 of colorplot.sh, set $shelfmc to your ShelfMC directory. This directory should hold the parameter space scan directory, and a directory called "outputs". The "outputs" directory may be empty.

Make sure colorplot.sh has execute permission - if not, type 'chmod u+x colorplot.sh'

Run the script by typing './colorplot.sh'

The following instructions will also be provided in the execution of the script.
- Enter the name of the run as prompted
- Make your selections for the two variables to plot along the X- and Y- axes. Your options are:
  A - Attenuation Length
  R - Antenna Radius
  I - Ice Thickness
  F - Firn Thickness
  S - Station Depth
- Select values at which to hold the remaining parameters constant. Please select only the numbers allowed as prompted.
- Exit root
- Your plot will be in $shelfmc/outputs/[name of scan]
